_*_*_*_*_ FIXES AND CHANGES _*_*_*_*_
 * * * *    
[12][2012-05-28-16:50]
	(001) Added sound to small explosion
	(002) Added death cry to chicken 
[11][2012-05-28-13:00]
	(001) Added a small explosion entity
	(002) Animated small explosion entity
	(003) Implemented small explosion with chicken - when struck by incendio, chicken explodes 
[10][2012-05-27-22:57]
	(001) Added a chicken entity
	(002) Animated chicken entity
	(003) Created CoMoveLinearPath component - implementing entities will indefinitely follow a straight-line path.
	(004) Chicken now uses CoMoveLinearPath
[9][2012-05-25-20:00]
	(001) Animated Incendio.
	(002) When Incendio collides with a non-player object, it adds the CoTimedRemoval component.
	(003) Added the Wand class.
	(004) Added a setCollisionType method in Entity. This will be used for when the wand flies off and can collide into things.
	(005) Removed the spawning of a Spark on the player when the game starts.
	(006) Added the CoMoveWand class.
	(007) Changed where CoCastPlayer spawned Incendio by creating a static variable in Wand. Incendio now spawns off of the wand tip. 

[8][2012-05-25-17:00]
    (001) All collision types are now fully functional!
    (002) Deleted test classes: SquarePlayer, CoWSAD.
    (003) Moved collision code from rock to Incendio (where I should have put it all along).
    (004) Tweaked code so that Player will not stick in anything.
    (005) Added Crates. (Since WideCrate already existed, a regular Crate seemed reasonable.)
    (006) Renamed: WideCrate -> Crate_Wide. This allows for easier sorting of large collections of Entities.
    
[7][2012-05-23-15:30]
    (001) Added functionality for rectangle-rectangle collisions.
    (002) Added pseudo-functionality for rectangle-circle collisions (treats collision like rectangle-rectangle for now).
    (003) Added CoWSAD (Like CoMovePlayer, but without mouse rotation).
    (004) Added (most likely temporary) Entities for testing new collisions: SquarePlayer, WideCrate.

[6][2012-05-22-17:15]
	(001) Added an add/remover for Collidable in the GameplayState.  I'm considering overhauling access code for GameplayState.
	(002) Changed Collidinator and Collidable to pass the StateBasedGame to collision methods (so you can add/remove during collisions).
	(003) Added CoTimedRemoval (mighty useful, if I do say so myself!)
	(004) Added CoAnimate.  Use: CoAnimate(id, Image with spritesheet, width of each tile in sheet, length of each tile in sheet).
	(005) Added a collision between Incendio and Rocks. (Spark positioning is a bit buggy.)

[5][2012-05-19-14:00]

	(001) Added queues for removing elements from llRendered and llUpdated.
	(002) Gave CoMoveLinear the ability to remove owners from llRendered/llUpdated if the owner travels a certain distance.
	(003) Fixed trajectory calculation in CoMoveLinear by converting to radians.
	(004) Changed player.png and the collisionRadii of Player.
	(005) Spells are now created at the edge of the owner's collision radius.
	(006) Added incendio.wav.

[4][2012-05-19-01:00]

    (001) Reverted fix (009) in revision [3].  Used Collidinator.add() instead.
    (002) Removed unneeded declaration of rotation in Incendio. 
    (003) Fixed a concurrent modification error in adding Entities to llRendered and llUpdated during the render and update methods.
    (004) Fixed the null pointer error in CoMoveLinear, which was trying to access its (non-existent) owner in the constructor.

[3][2012-05-17-12:00]

	(001) Changed the id of CoRender in Rock to be consistent with the component id's of Player.
	(002) Added Incendio class.
	(003) Added CoMoveLinear class.
	(004) Added CoCastPlayer class.
	(005) Renamed CoMovement to CoMovePlayer.
	(006) Renamed the variable "direction" to "rotation" in CoMovePlayer to keep things clear.
	(007) Added llUpdated and llRendered LinkedLists.
	(008) Added addUpdated and addRendered methods to GameplayState.
	(009) Changed the visibility of Collidinator's collisionRoll to protected for access by GameplayState when adding the rocks ArrayList.

[2][2012-05-16-17:00]
    
    (001) Moved component addition for Player into its constructor.  This is where components should be added.
    (002) Edited player sprite so that it has an arrow facing left.
    (003) Simplified the rotation code for Player.
    (004) Added Rock class.
    (005) Created a simple collision roll.  See Collidinator and its use in GameplayState for more information.
    (006) Specified a collision radius in Player's constructor.
    (007) Added id_ent to GameplayState, which can be used as an iterator for Entity ids.
    (008) Moved Player to the entities package, as it is an entity.  If further categorization is needed, sub-packages should be used.
    (009) Deleted some useless debug code from CoMovement.
    (010) Fixed a bug where all game states were getting initiated twice.
    (011) Cluttered the garden.

[1][2012-05-16-19:30]
	
	(001) Made Entity class variables protected, rather than private.  They can now be accessed by subclasses.
	(002) Deleted Player class variables which are no longer necessary due to fix (001).
	(003) Deleted CoMovement class variable <id>, which is inherited from Component and need not be declared.
	(004) Moved all movement related class variables from Player to CoMovement.  Keep code in the components when possible.
		  After all,  it'll be easier to switch out movement components (for flight, buffs, etc.) If the speeds are saved locally.
	(005) Fixed initialization of Player and CoMovement for compatibility with fix (004).
	(006) In initialization of Player, changed collisionType from <1> to <Collidable.TC_CIRCLE>.  It makes code more readable.
	(007) In initialization of CoMovement, changed id from <1> to <2> to avoid conflicts with CoRender.
	(008) Deleted getX() and getY() in CoMovement.  Getters are only needed if people have reason to access the variables.
	(009) Made speedY in CoMovement private.  Not sure why it was set to public.
	(010) Changed update() of CoMovement to use owner.addX() and owner.addY(), so the position vector doesn't have to be fetched.
	(011) Gave CoMovement's update method a complete overhaul to resolve keystroke conflicts. See the code for specific changes.
	(012) Lowered friction in CoMovement from 0.0015 to 0.0005.  It feels more realistic this way.
	(013) Lowered the Player's baseSpeed from 0.15 to 0.11.
	(014) Changed render() in CoRender so that the image is centered on the position.
	(015) Added lots of javadoc comments.
