	(001) Made Entity class variables protected, rather than private.  They can now be accessed by subclasses.
	(002) Deleted Player class variables which are no longer necessary due to fix (001).
	(003) Deleted CoMovement class variable <id>, which is inherited from Component and need not be declared.
	(004) Moved all movement related class variables from Player to CoMovement.  Keep code in the components when possible.
		  After all,  it'll be easier to switch out movement components (for flight, buffs, etc.) If the speeds are saved locally.
	(005) Fixed initialization of Player and CoMovement for compatibility with fix (004).
	(006) In initialization of Player, changed collisionType from <1> to <Collidable.TC_CIRCLE>.  It makes code more readable.
	(007) In initialization of CoMovement, changed id from <1> to <2> to avoid conflicts with CoRender.
	(008) Deleted getX() and getY() in CoMovement.  Getters are only needed if people have reason to access the variables.
	(009) Made speedY in CoMovement private.  Not sure why it was set to public.
	(010) Changed update() of CoMovement to use owner.addX() and owner.addY(), so the position vector doesn't have to be fetched.
	(011) Gave CoMovement's update method a complete overhaul to resolve keystroke conflicts. See the code for specific changes.
	(012) Lowered friction in CoMovement from 0.0015 to 0.0005.  It feels more realistic this way.
	(013) Lowered the Player's baseSpeed from 0.15 to 0.11.
	(014) Changed render() in CoRender so that the image is centered on the position.
	(015) Added lots of javadoc comments.
