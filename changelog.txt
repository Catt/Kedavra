	(001) Changed the id of CoRender in Rock to be consistent with the component id's of Player.
	(002) Added Incendio class.
	(003) Added CoMoveLinear class.
	(004) Added CoCastPlayer class.
	(005) Renamed CoMovement to CoMovePlayer.
	(006) Renamed the variable "direction" to "rotation" in CoMovePlayer to keep things clear.
	(007) Added llUpdated and llRendered LinkedLists.

	(009) Changed the visibility of Collidinator's collisionRoll to protected for access by GameplayState when adding the rocks ArrayList.

    (001) Moved component addition for Player into its constructor.  This is where components should be added.
    (002) Edited player sprite so that it has an arrow facing left.
    (003) Simplified the rotation code for Player.
    (004) Added Rock class.
    (005) Created a simple collision roll.  See Collidinator and its use in GameplayState for more information.
    (006) Specified a collision radius in Player's constructor.
    (007) Added id_ent to GameplayState, which can be used as an iterator for Entity ids.
    (008) Moved Player to the entities package, as it is an entity.  If further categorization is needed, sub-packages should be used.
    (009) Deleted some useless debug code from CoMovement.
    (010) Fixed a bug where all game states were getting initiated twice.
    (011) Cluttered the garden.

	(001) Made Entity class variables protected, rather than private.  They can now be accessed by subclasses.
	(002) Deleted Player class variables which are no longer necessary due to fix (001).
	(003) Deleted CoMovement class variable <id>, which is inherited from Component and need not be declared.
	(004) Moved all movement related class variables from Player to CoMovement.  Keep code in the components when possible.
		  After all,  it'll be easier to switch out movement components (for flight, buffs, etc.) If the speeds are saved locally.
	(005) Fixed initialization of Player and CoMovement for compatibility with fix (004).
	(006) In initialization of Player, changed collisionType from <1> to <Collidable.TC_CIRCLE>.  It makes code more readable.
	(007) In initialization of CoMovement, changed id from <1> to <2> to avoid conflicts with CoRender.
	(008) Deleted getX() and getY() in CoMovement.  Getters are only needed if people have reason to access the variables.
	(009) Made speedY in CoMovement private.  Not sure why it was set to public.
	(010) Changed update() of CoMovement to use owner.addX() and owner.addY(), so the position vector doesn't have to be fetched.
	(011) Gave CoMovement's update method a complete overhaul to resolve keystroke conflicts. See the code for specific changes.
	(012) Lowered friction in CoMovement from 0.0015 to 0.0005.  It feels more realistic this way.
	(013) Lowered the Player's baseSpeed from 0.15 to 0.11.
	(014) Changed render() in CoRender so that the image is centered on the position.
	(015) Added lots of javadoc comments.
