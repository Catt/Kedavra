----TO DO----
1) Implement health/damage system in already existing entities.
2) Finish Chicken's collision detection.
3) Implement burn method in Incendio (perhaps create an interface Burnable for entities?).
4) Implementation required for these spells:
	-Incendio
	-Avada Kedavra
	-Confringo
	-Crucio
	-Diffindo
	-Expulso
	-Reducto
	-Sectumsempra
5) New graphics required for:
	-Petrificus Totalus (currently looks like Incendio)
	-Chicken(?) (If we want stunned creatures to look different)
